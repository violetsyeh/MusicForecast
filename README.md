# MusicForecast
MusicForecast provides users a tool to find Spotify playlists based on the weather condition through the AccuWeather API. Through OAuth2 authorization, they are able to login into their own Spotify account to make modifications  and have access to playlists they currently follow. Users are able to view and follow playlists found through the weather condition and featured playlists of that day. Entire song playback is accessible when the user's account is verified, otherwise, 30 second playback is available.
